### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been building React, Golang, Mobile app in day time professionally.

At night, I work on interesting project.

Release in 2020:

- ðŸ”­ [KapMod](https://github.com/ilovejs/KapMod), is a low-CPU, Video Capturing Tool based on Electron. It's quicker and lighter than Screenflow, Snagit, Movavi
- ðŸ“« [AppUtils](https://github.com/HelloSundayMorning/apputils) Go Microservice Library: GraphQL, k8s, queue, http, x-ray tracing, saga manager etc.
- [uniswap v1 updates](https://github.com/ilovejs/uniswap-v1-mz) I was interested in how AMM works. I've updated contracts to solve common pains. 
It compiles, better than it's official cousin.
